# Natural Language Processing using Deep Learning

Experimenting with Natural Language Processing using Deep Learning techniques. They're based on the course [Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning in Python](https://www.udemy.com/natural-language-processing-with-deep-learning-in-python/) but using Jupyter notebooks with personal changes in order for me to learn by doing.

## Exercises
1. Working with Word Vectors
    - [Pre-trained word vector from GloVe](Word%20Vectors/Pretrained%20GloVe.ipynb)
    - [Pre-trained word vector from Word2Vec](Word%20Vectors/Pretrained%20Word2Vec.ipynb)

TODO: more experiments
